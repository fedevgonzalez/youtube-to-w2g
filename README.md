## 📖 Why This Exists

You know that moment when you're watching YouTube and find *the perfect* video to share with your friends on Watch2Gether? Yeah, me too. The whole copy URL → switch tabs → paste → hope it works thing got old real fast.

So I built Y2W – a simple Chrome extension that adds a "Y2W" button right in the YouTube player. One click and boom, your video is in the W2G room. No more tab juggling!

## 📋 What is Y2W?

YouTube to Watch2Gether (Y2W) is a Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates with YouTube. It's literally just a button that does one thing really well: sends videos to your Watch2Gether room instantly.

### ✨ Features

- 🎬 **One-Click Magic**: See video → Click button → Video appears in W2G. That's it!
- 🔄 **Feels Native**: The button looks like it belongs there (because it does)
- 🎯 **Works Everywhere**: Theater mode? ✓ Fullscreen? ✓ Mobile view? ✓ We got you
- 🔐 **Your Keys, Your Rules**: Everything stays in your browser's secure storage
- ⚡ **Zero Bloat**: So lightweight you'll forget it's there (until you need it)

## 🚀 Installation

🎉 **Y2W is now available on the Chrome Web Store!**

2. Click **"Add to Chrome"**
3. The extension will be installed automatically
4. Follow the configuration steps below
