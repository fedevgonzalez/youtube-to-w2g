- No more developer mode needed (unless you're into that sort of thing)

### Added
- Initial release! üéâ
- The magical "Y2W" button that appears in YouTube videos
- Configuration popup for API credentials (because security matters)
- Support for all YouTube layouts (yes, even that weird theater mode)

### The Journey So Far

**2025-01-08** - The Great Rebranding

- Fixed that annoying bug where the button wouldn't show up sometimes

**2025-01-07** - Birth of the Project
- Had the idea while manually copying URLs for the 100th time
- Built the MVP in a caffeine-fueled coding session
- It actually worked! (I was as surprised as you are)

### Known Issues
- Button might take a second to appear on slow connections
- Fullscreen mode can be finicky on some videos
- My friends keep asking for a Firefox version
