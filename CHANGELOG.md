## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-10

### üéä We're Live on Chrome Web Store!
- Y2W is now officially available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/y2w-youtube-to-watch2geth/afgajabndpahomibkdlpgejbfmlfckig)
- No more developer mode needed (unless you're into that sort of thing)

### Added
- Initial release! üéâ
- The magical "Y2W" button that appears in YouTube videos
- Configuration popup for API credentials (because security matters)
- Support for all YouTube layouts (yes, even that weird theater mode)
- Visual feedback for button states (loading, success, error)
- Icon that actually looks decent (took me way too many iterations)

### The Journey So Far

**2025-01-09** - Added proper open-source documentation
- Created CONTRIBUTING.md (come help me make this better!)
- Added CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (be nice, please)
- Rewrote README to be less robotic and more human
- You're reading this CHANGELOG right now!

**2025-01-08** - The Great Rebranding
- Changed from W2Y to Y2W (because it makes more sense, duh)
- Updated all icons and references
- Fixed that annoying bug where the button wouldn't show up sometimes

**2025-01-07** - Birth of the Project
- Had the idea while manually copying URLs for the 100th time
- Built the MVP in a caffeine-fueled coding session
- It actually worked! (I was as surprised as you are)

### Known Issues
- Button might take a second to appear on slow connections
- Fullscreen mode can be finicky on some videos
- My friends keep asking for a Firefox version

### What's Next?
Check out the [README Roadmap](README.md#-roadmap) for planned features. Spoiler: keyboard shortcuts are coming!
